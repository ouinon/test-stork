# Stork

Firstly if you've never heard of [Stork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork_(margarine)) butter (technically a margarine), the witty wordplay of this little project is entirely lost on you and that's a crying-shame.

I used to use Yeoman as a build tool but have since customized it to my own needs, [Takana](https://github.com/mechio/takana) is a significantly faster compiler for SASS and I prefer to use Apache as a web-server rather than firing up Node every time. [Atomizer](https://github.com/yahoo/grunt-atomizer/) is a really great tool from Yahoo that I have customized, I like it for prototyping.
